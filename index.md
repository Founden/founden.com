    Previous challenges
  </h3>

  <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
    <strong>Company <code>IM01</code></strong> worked with us for about 2 years.
    We built their remote product team. Helped sunset the legacy version for
    4000+ corporate customers. Saved their infrastructure costs by architecting
    an automated data processing pipeline, with internal and external data
    sources, for the operations where data went
    from 3<acronym title="Terabyte">TB</acronym>, down to
    1<acronym title="Terabyte">TB</acronym>.
  </p>

  <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
    <strong>Company <code>ID01</code></strong> worked with us for about 1 year
    part-time. We replaced the old version of about 80000 lines of code with
    a modern <acronym title="Single-page application">SPA</acronym> with
    minimal changes to their database layout. The product
    passed an open initiative for penetration testing and ended up being
    about 10000 lines of code with a >90% test coverage and minimal maintenance
    efforts.

  <p class="measure-wide lh-copy">
    <strong>Company <code>IM02</code></strong> worked with us for about 2 years
    part-time. We helped them move away from a third-party authentication
    solution and redesigned and migrated most of their core features with a
    minimum impact on their customers. One of the biggest challenge was to
    architect a pragmatic
    <acronym title="Application programming interface">API</acronym> for running
    analytics/aggregations on any stored dataset for the product charting tool.
    We also drafted most of the legal content to cover the
    <acronym title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</acronym>
    requirements for highly-sensitive data controller and to align it with the
    internal operational processes.
