        <strong>Company <code>IM01</code></strong> worked with us for about 2 years.
        We built their remote product team. Helped sunset the legacy version for
        4000+ corporate customers. Saved their infrastructure costs by architecting
        an automated data processing pipeline, with internal and external data
        sources, for the operations where data went
        from 3<acronym title="Terabyte">TB</acronym>, down to
        1<acronym title="Terabyte">TB</acronym>.

        <strong>Company <code>ID01</code></strong> worked with us for about 1 year
        part-time. We replaced the old version of about 80000 lines of code with
        a modern <acronym title="Single-page application">SPA</acronym> with
        minimal changes to their database layout. The product
        passed an open initiative for penetration testing and ended up being
        about 10000 lines of code with a >90% test coverage and minimal maintenance
        efforts.

        <strong>Company <code>IM02</code></strong> worked with us for about 2 years
        part-time. We helped them move away from a third-party authentication
        solution and redesigned and migrated most of their core features with a
        minimum impact on their customers. One of the biggest challenge was to
        architect a pragmatic
        <acronym title="Application programming interface">API</acronym> for running
        analytics/aggregations on any stored dataset for the product charting tool.
        We also drafted most of the legal content to cover the
        <acronym title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</acronym>
        requirements for highly-sensitive data controller and to align it with the
        internal operational processes.
